        <p>
          My Bachelor’s Degree is in Art History, from the University of Illinois - Chicago and I recently finished my Masters’ Degree in Art History at the University of Wisconsin – Milwaukee. My thesis focuses on Confederate Monuments and the
          performances surrounding their construction. I investigate the ways in which public demonstrations have affected social acceptability not only of Confederate memorialization, but also how the process of commemoration relates with social norms and
          political structures.
